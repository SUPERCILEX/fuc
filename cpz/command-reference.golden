A zippy alternative to `cp`, a tool to copy files and directories

Usage: cpz [OPTIONS] <FROM>... <TO>

Arguments:
  <FROM>...
          The file(s) or directory(ies) to be copied
          
          If multiple files are specified, they will be copied into the target destination rather
          than to it. The same is true of directory names (`foo/`, `.`, `..`): that is, `cpz a b/`
          places `a` inside `b` as opposed to `cpz a b` which makes `b` become `a`.

  <TO>
          The copy destination

Options:
  -f, --force
          Overwrite existing files

  -t, --reverse-args
          Reverse the argument order so that it becomes `cpz <TO> <FROM>...`

  -L, --dereference
          always follow symbolic links in source

  -h, --help
          Print help (use `-h` for a summary)

  -V, --version
          Print version
